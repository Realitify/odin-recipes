        <p>Hmm... So you have chosen Salmon glazed with Garlic and Honey. An unusual recipe, don't you think? I'd say the most unique out of the three, and who knows, if you prepare it right, it might even be the best!</p>
        <p>Here is what you are going to need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 salmon fillets</li>
            <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
            <li>Sesame seeds, for garnish</li>
            <li>Sliced green onions, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Alright, now that you have all the ingredients, it's time to get to the real work! Here is how to prepare the best dish you will ever taste!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together the honey, soy sauce, lemon juice, minced garlic, olive oil, black pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using) to make the glaze.</li>
            <li>Place the salmon fillets in a shallow dish or a zip-lock bag, and pour half of the glaze over them. Make sure the salmon is coated evenly. Reserve the other half of the glaze for later.</li>
            <li>Marinate the salmon in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes (you can marinate it longer for more flavor).</li>
            <li>Preheat the grill or a pan over medium-high heat. If grilling, lightly oil the grill grates to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Remove the salmon from the marinade and discard the used marinade.</li>
            <li>Grill the salmon for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until the fish is cooked through and has grill marks. If using a pan, cook the salmon skin-side down first, for about 4 minutes, then flip and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the salmon is cooking, heat the reserved glaze in a small saucepan over medium heat until it thickens slightly.</li>
            <li>Once the salmon is done, drizzle the heated glaze over the top.</li>
            <li>Garnish with sesame seeds and sliced green onions before serving. You can serve this delicious honey garlic glazed salmon with steamed vegetables or rice.</li>
        </ol>
