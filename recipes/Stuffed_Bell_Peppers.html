        <p>Good choice! Quite an uncommon recipe don't you think? This is what makes it one of the best, it's originality. My grandma herself made a version of this, and I promise you, nothing beats a balkan's grandma cooking, or better said "babushka". So you know it's legit. Anyways, I won't hold ya any longer, let's get started!</p>
        <p>The ingredients you are going to need are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large bell peppers (any color)</li>
            <li>1 cup quinoa, rinsed</li>
            <li>1 can (15 oz) black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>1 cup diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
            <li>1 cup diced zucchini</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (optional)</li>
            <li>Fresh cilantro, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Alright, I'm sure you are now asking yourself what to do. You have the ingredients, but you don't know how to continue. Don't worry, I got you!</p>
        <p>Here is what you need to do:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove the seeds and membranes. Rinse them well.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onions and garlic, and sauté until translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the diced zucchini, ground cumin, chili powder, paprika, salt, and pepper to the skillet. Cook for about 5 minutes until the zucchini is slightly tender.</li>
            <li>Stir in the diced tomatoes, black beans, and quinoa. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until everything is well combined and heated through.</li>
            <li>Stuff each bell pepper with the quinoa and black bean mixture, pressing it down lightly as you fill them.</li>
            <li>Place the stuffed bell peppers in a baking dish. If using cheese, sprinkle the shredded cheddar on top of each pepper.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the bell peppers are tender.</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 5 minutes to melt the cheese (if using).</li>
            <li>Garnish with fresh cilantro before serving.</li>
        </ol>
